# calculus_probs
A web app built with Django for practicing solving indefinite integral questions.

The most interesting single piece may be [this script](https://github.com/alex-bearden/calculus_probs/blob/main/calc_site/calc_probs/indef_integral_checker.py), which checks if the class of functions you enter is the correct class.

See <http://alexbearden.pythonanywhere.com/calc_probs/> for the finished product.
